1. is it qualitative or quantitative (average make sense?)
  1.1 if qualitative, use different colors or shapes (nominal or ordinal variables) --> typology map
    e.g., gentrifying vs. non-gentrifying tracts
2. does the sum make sense?
  2.1 absolute - size (e.g., total population, total number of museums) --> proportional symbol
  2.2. relative - color gradiation (e.g., % white; diversity index/segregation index) --> chorolpeth map
