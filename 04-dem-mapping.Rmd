## Data Visualization

With spatial data merged with demographic attributes, we can create demographic measures of interest. Here, I introduce three key measures used in urban scholarship: gentrification and diversity. 

### Creating demographic measures

1. Gentrification - qualitative, typology

2. Diversity - quantitative, chereology

### Mapping gentrification

Gentrification - qualitative

### Mapping diversity



*Data sources*

Aggregated demographic data and spatial boundaries are collected and disseminated by national and municipal government, as well as international organizations (e.g., United Nations).
