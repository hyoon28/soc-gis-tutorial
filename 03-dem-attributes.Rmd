## Joining attributes


Geographic boundaries alone don't tell us much about what is social about them. Sociologists, and social scientists more broadly, often are interested in **people** in these places. Therefore, matching aggregated demographic data with the geographic boundaries is a crucial next step. 

We can merge a sf object with a data frame containing demographic attributes using the merge() function. 

```{r import-dem}
# Import demographic attributes
sfdem <- read.csv("data/sfnh_dem.csv")

# Check common identifier
names(sfdem)
  # Yes, in both data sets, "nhood" exists.
```

```{r join-att}
# Join attributes to geometry
sf_joined <- merge(
  x = sfnh,            # sf object; the returned object will be of the same type as x.
  y = sfdem,           # data frame
  by.x = "nhood",      # x identifier
  by.y = "nhood",      # y identifier
  all.x = TRUE         # keep all lines
)

# Validate geometries
sf_joined <- st_make_valid(sf_joined)
```

Now, we can explore neighborhood-level characteristics.

```{r explore-joined, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Display the share of white population of neighborhoods
sf_joined %>%
  select(nhood, pwhite)

# Display the neighborhood named "Mission"
sf_joined %>% 
  filter(nhood == "Mission")

# Display the share of white population of "Mission"
sf_joined %>%
  filter(nhood == "Mission") %>%
  select(pwhite)
```


In maps, we can highlight specific neighborhoods by creating conditions.

```{r highlgiht-neighborhood}
# Create conditions for highlights
sf_joined <- sf_joined %>%
  mutate(
    highlight_mission = ifelse(nhood == "Mission", "Highlighted", "Other"), # highlight the Mission
    highlight_white = ifelse(pwhite > 70, "Highlighted", "Other")           # highlight white neighborhoods
  )

# Create highlighted maps
mission_map <- ggplot(data = sf_joined) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = highlight_mission), # specify a variable to fill
          color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Highlighted" = "red", "Other" = "light grey")) + # specify colors to fill
  theme_minimal() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # remove legend

white_map <- ggplot(data = sf_joined) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = highlight_white), 
    color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Highlighted" = "red", "Other" = "light grey")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  

# Combining maps
ggpubr::ggarrange(mission_map, white_map, ncol=2,
                  labels = c("The Mission",
                             "White Neighborhoods")
                  ) 
```

```{r export-joined, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Export your joined sf object as a geojson file
st_write(sf_joined, "processed-data/sfnh_dem_joined.geojson", 
         driver = "GeoJSON",
         delete_dsn = TRUE # overwrite the existing file
         )
```



**THINK AND SHARE**

Below, you see two maps, each representing Chicago ans Seattle.

 - What are the geographic boundaries used in this figure?
 - What attribute is displayed in the map?
 - Is this attribute quantitative or qualitative?
