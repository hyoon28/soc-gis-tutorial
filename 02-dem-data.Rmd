# Emplacing Demographic Data


In this chapter, we will discuss demographic data nested in places, which is often used in sociological research. Sociologists often study where people live and move to. Topics like migration, segregation, gentrification, integration/assimilation, and diversity/fractionalization can be studied using aggregated demographic data for a given geographic unit. As a first step, defining a geographic unit and boundary suitable for your analysis is critical.

## Defining boundaries

Geographic boundaries can be defined and drawn at various levels, from nations to cities to neighborhoods. Territories are contested and (re)defined through social processes, therefore, it is important to clearly define and justify your choice of spatial boundary as a unit of analysis. Common topics studied by urban sociologists, for instance, often involves neighborhood dynamics. But what are neighborhoods? While government-defined census tracts are often used as a proxy for neighborhoods in quantitative social science research, some scholars choose to analyze other types of boundaries, such as "community areas" that are more meaningful to its residents.



**THE CASE OF SAN FRANCISCO**

Let's demonstrate the importance of defining neighborhood boundaries using the case of San Francisco. San Francisco's neighborhood names and boundaries have changed over time [(1)](https://www.sfgate.com/places/article/What-did-your-neighborhood-used-to-be-called-15098783.php) and the current names and boundaries are often inconsistently perceived and administered [(2)](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2022/san-francisco-neighborhoods/). The image below, for example, compares the old and current neighborhood names and boundaries in San Francisco.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to visualize San Francisco neighborhoods based on census tracts as well as the "Analysis Neighborhood" created by the city officials. Many US city governments provide their local data through Open Data websites, including San Francisco's [DataSF](https://datasf.org/opendata/). Open their website and then click the "Geographic Locations & Boundaries" tab.

Under this tab, you will find the 2010 census tract and "Analysis Neighborhood" boundaries, among many other geographic data.

 - Geographic boundaries data can come in various formats, like geojson, shapefiles, etc.
 - In this tutorial, we use geojson files.
 - Geographic boundaries are "polygons"
 - We use **sf package** in R to handle spatial data.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Set CRAN mirror
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
rm(list = ls())
```

Set up and import geojson files.

```{r import-sf, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# First, you will have to set up by installing and calling the sf package.
library(sf)
```

```{r import-sf-data, results='hide'}
# Import neighborhood boundaries data (polygons)
sfnh <- st_read("data/sfnh.geojson") # for "Analysis Neighborhood" boundaries
sftrt <- st_read("data/sftrt_clean.geojson") # for census tracts

```

You can treat sf objects like data frames.

```{r overview}
# Overview of variables
head(sfnh, 3)
```

```{r transform}
# Transform an sf object into a simple one data frame (without geometries)
sfnh_wo_geo <- st_drop_geometry(sfnh)

head(sfnh_wo_geo, 3)
```

We can compare how San Francisco neighborhood boundaries differ by mapping them next to each other. We use ggplot for mapping.

```{r boundary-map}
library(ggplot2)

# Displaying geometry for "analysis neighborhood" boundaries
sfnh_geo <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = sfnh, # add a layer to the plot using spatial data
          fill = "grey", # set the fill color of the spatial features
          color = "white", # set the color of boundaries
          size = 0.5) +  # set the thickness of the boundary lines
  theme_void()  # apply no background

# Replicate the map using census tract boundaries
sftrt_geo <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sftrt, fill = "grey", color = "white", size = 0.5) +  
  theme_void()  

# Combining maps
ggpubr::ggarrange(sfnh_geo, sftrt_geo, ncol=2,
                  labels = c("Analysis Neighborhood",
                             "2010 Census Tract")
                  ) 
```


**THINK AND SHARE**

[New York Times Upshot report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/upshot/extremely-detailed-nyc-neighborhood-map.html) did a great job exploring New York City's neighborhood boundaries using crowd-sourced data. They asked residents of New York City to demarcate neighborhood boundaries and identify their names. It provides a fascinating window to understand the sticky yet malleable nature of geographic boundaries.

 - Think of various geographic levels of analysis.
 - What questions could we ask about them?
 - How will you define their boundaries?
